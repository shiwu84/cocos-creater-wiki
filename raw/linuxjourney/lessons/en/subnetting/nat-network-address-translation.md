## Lesson Content

We've brought up NAT (Network Address Translation) before but didn't touch upon it. When we are working on our network, does that mean the internet can see our IP address? Not quite.

NAT makes a device like our router act as an intermediary between the internet and a private network. So, only a single, unique IP address is required to represent an entire group of computers.

Think of NAT as a receptionist in a large office. If someone wants to contact you, they only know the number to the whole office. The receptionist would then have to look for your extension number and forward the call to you.

### How does it work?

A simple case would look like this:

1. Patty wants to connect to `www.google.com`, so her machine sends this request through the router.
2. The router takes that request and opens its own connection to google.com, then it sends Patty's request once it makes a connection.
3. The router is the intermediary between Patty and `www.google.com`. Google doesn't know about Patty; instead, all it can see is the router.

NAT and packet routing in general can get pretty ugly, but we won't dive into the specifics.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of network addressing and connectivity, which are foundational to understanding concepts like NAT:

1. **[Identify MAC and IP Addresses in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-identify-mac-and-ip-addresses-in-linux-592731)** - Practice using the `ip a` command to identify network addressing information, including IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, on a Linux system.
2. **[Manage IP Addressing in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-ip-addressing-in-linux-592736)** - Learn to manage IP addressing by configuring static and dynamic IPs, and verifying network configuration, which helps in understanding how devices get their addresses.
3. **[Explore IP Address Types and Reachability in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-explore-ip-address-types-and-reachability-in-linux-592780)** - Explore different IP address types (private, public, multicast) and test network reachability, providing a practical context for how NAT distinguishes between internal and external addresses.

These labs will help you apply the concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with network configuration and troubleshooting in Linux.
