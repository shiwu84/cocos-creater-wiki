## Lesson Content

This lesson provides a foundational overview of systemd unit files and how to manage them with `systemctl`, the primary tool for controlling the init system. We will cover the basic structure of a unit file and the essential commands for managing Linux services.

### Understanding a Systemd Unit File

A systemd unit file is a plain text file that describes a service, a mount point, a device, or another resource that systemd can manage. Here is a basic example of a service unit file named `foobar.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=My Foobar Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/foobar

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This simple service file is divided into sections:

- **[Unit]**: This section contains metadata and dependency information. The `Description` provides a human-readable name for the unit. Directives like `After` and `Before` control the startup order, ensuring this unit starts after the network is available.
- **[Service]**: This section defines how to manage the service. The `ExecStart` directive is crucial, as it specifies the command to execute to start the service. Other directives like `ExecStop` and `ExecReload` can define how to stop or reload the service.
- **[Install]**: This section defines the behavior of the unit when it is enabled or disabled with `systemctl`. The `WantedBy` directive tells systemd to start this service as part of a specific target, such as the `multi-user.target` for a standard non-graphical boot.

This is just a glimpse into systemd unit files. For more advanced configurations, further reading on the topic is highly recommended.

### Essential Systemctl Commands

Now, let's explore the essential `systemctl` commands you'll use to interact with systemd units and manage Linux services.

### Listing Systemd Units

To see all active units that systemd is currently managing, use the `list-units` command.

```bash
systemctl list-units
```

### Checking a Unit's Status

To view the detailed status of a specific unit, including whether it's active, enabled, and its latest log entries, use the `status` command.

```bash
systemctl status networking.service
```

### Managing Service States

You can control the runtime state of a service using `start`, `stop`, and `restart`.

To start a service immediately:

```bash
sudo systemctl start networking.service
```

To stop a running service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop networking.service
```

To stop and then start the service again:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking.service
```

### Enabling and Disabling Services

Enabling a service creates a symbolic link that hooks it into the boot process, ensuring it starts automatically. Disabling it removes that link.

To enable a service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable networking.service
```

To disable a service from starting on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable networking.service
```

These commands are the building blocks for service management on modern Linux systems. Mastering them is a key step in your Linux journey.

## Exercise

Practice is key to mastering new skills. This hands-on lab will help reinforce your understanding of managing processes, which are often controlled by systemd services:

1. **[Manage and Monitor Linux Processes](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-and-monitor-linux-processes-590864)** - Practice interacting with foreground and background processes, inspecting them with `ps`, monitoring resources with `top`, adjusting priority with `renice`, and terminating them with `kill`. This lab will give you practical experience with the runtime effects of systemd unit management.

This lab will help you apply these concepts in a real-world scenario and build confidence with process management in Linux.
