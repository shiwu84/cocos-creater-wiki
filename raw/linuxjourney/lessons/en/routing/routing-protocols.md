## Lesson Content

Manually configuring routes on a routing table for every device on a large network would be an incredibly tedious task. To automate this process, we use dynamic **routing protocols**. These protocols allow routers to adapt to network changes automatically by learning different routes, building them into the routing table, and forwarding packets accordingly. There are two primary types of routing protocols: distance vector and link state.

### Distance Vector Protocols

Distance vector protocols operate on the principle of "routing by rumor." Each router shares its entire routing table with its directly connected neighbors at regular intervals. When a router receives a routing table from a neighbor, it updates its own table with any new or better routes. The "distance" is typically measured by a metric like hop count. This method is simple but can be slow to converge and is susceptible to routing loops. An example of a distance vector protocol is the Routing Information Protocol (RIP).

### Link State Protocols

In contrast, **link state protocols** provide each router with a complete map of the network topology. Instead of sharing their entire routing table, routers send out information about the state of their own links (e.g., connected neighbors and the cost of the connection) to all other routers on the network. Using this information, every router can independently build an identical map of the network and calculate the best path to every destination. This approach leads to faster **network convergence** and is more scalable than distance vector protocols. An example is the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol.

### Network Convergence

Before we discuss protocols further, it's important to understand a key concept in routing known as **network convergence**. When using routing protocols, routers communicate to collect and exchange information. Convergence is the state where all routers have a consistent and accurate view of the network topology. When every routing table correctly maps the entire network, the network is considered "converged." If a change occurs, such as a link going down, convergence is temporarily broken until all routers learn about the change and update their routing tables.

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of network routing and IP addressing:

1. **[Manage IP Addressing in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-manage-ip-addressing-in-linux-592736)** - Practice configuring static and dynamic IP addresses, setting a default gateway, and verifying network configurations, which are crucial for understanding how routing tables are built and utilized.
2. **[Explore Network Layer Interaction with ping and arp in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-explore-network-layer-interaction-with-ping-and-arp-in-linux-592746)** - Learn how devices interact at the network layer, observing ARP and how the default gateway handles remote traffic, providing insight into the mechanisms routing protocols manage.
3. **[Simulate Network Layer Connectivity in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/comptia-simulate-network-layer-connectivity-in-linux-592752)** - Use Docker to simulate network nodes, assign IP addresses, and test connectivity across subnets, directly applying concepts related to network changes and routing decisions.

These labs will help you apply the concepts of network configuration and connectivity in real scenarios, building confidence with the foundational elements that routing protocols automate.
