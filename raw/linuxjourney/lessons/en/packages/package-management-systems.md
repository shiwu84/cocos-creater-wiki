## Lesson Content

Package managers are essential tools in Linux that simplify installing, updating, and removing software. They automatically handle dependencies, ensuring that all required libraries and components are installed correctly. Two of the most prominent package management systems are **yum** and **apt**.

### Yum vs Apt

The primary difference between these two systems lies in the Linux distributions they serve. The `yum` (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) package manager is used by RPM-based distributions like Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora. In contrast, `apt` (Advanced Package Tool) is the standard for Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu. While both `yum` and `apt` achieve the same goals, their command syntax differs.

### Installing and Removing Packages

To install a new piece of software from a repository, you use the `install` command.

```bash
Debian: $ apt install package_name
RPM: $ yum install package_name
```

To remove a package, the commands are also straightforward. `apt` uses `remove`, while `yum` uses `erase`.

```bash
Debian: $ apt remove package_name
RPM: $ yum erase package_name
```

### Updating and Inspecting Packages

It is a best practice to update your local package index before installing or upgrading software. This ensures you are getting the latest available versions.

For Debian systems, this is a two-step process: `apt update` refreshes the package list, and `apt upgrade` installs the new versions. For RPM systems, `yum update` handles both actions with a single command.

```bash
Debian: $ apt update; apt upgrade
RPM: $ yum update
```

If you need to get more details about a specific package, you can use the following commands to display information like its version, size, and description.

```bash
Debian: $ apt show package_name
RPM: $ yum info package_name
```

## Exercise

Practice makes perfect! Here are some hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding of Linux package management:

1. **[Query and Update Packages with YUM in Linux](https://labex.io/labs/rhel-query-and-update-packages-with-yum-in-linux-590869)** - Practice managing software packages on RHEL-based Linux systems using YUM, including inspecting, updating, and exploring repositories.
2. **[Software Installation on Linux](https://labex.io/labs/linux-software-installation-on-linux-18005)** - Learn various methods to install and manage software on Ubuntu systems, including using apt, dpkg, and handling .deb files.
3. **[Installing and Removing Packages](https://labex.io/labs/linux-installing-and-removing-packages-385380)** - Practice updating the system, installing and removing packages, and optimizing software configuration on a Debian-based system using `apt`.

These labs will help you apply the concepts in real scenarios and build confidence with Linux package management.
